   When you trust the folder, Claude Code offers to install these for you:
     superpowers, skill-creator, frontend-design, code-review  (official marketplace)
     context-mode            (marketplace: mksglu/context-mode)
     claude-mem              (marketplace: thedotmack/claude-mem)
   Approve the prompts. Then run /plugin to confirm they're enabled.

bold "3. MCP servers (one approval)"
cat <<'EOF'
   .mcp.json ships context7 + github + jupyter. After trusting the folder, approve them when asked
   (or run `claude mcp list`). The GitHub one needs GITHUB_PAT in your .env.

bold "4. gsd (optional, installed separately — NOT a repo plugin)"
cat <<'EOF'
   gsd ("get sh*t done") is a planning toolkit installed globally into ~/.claude, not via this repo.
   Install it from its project per its README, then its /gsd-* commands appear in every project.

cat <<'EOF'
   Converts PDFs/Office/HTML/images to clean Markdown. VS Code will recommend it automatically
   (.vscode/extensions.json). Or install from https://github.com/BioInfo/vscode-markitdown
